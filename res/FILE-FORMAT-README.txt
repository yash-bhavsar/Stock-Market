We have saved the portfolios and strategies in .csv files. We've saved the portfolio ticker, start date, number of shares and purchase price. In case of strategies, we are saving the number of the strategy, the amount user wants to invest, start date, end date and the frequency. We are also reading the individual portfolio files to plot a graph of how a portfolio changes over time. In the portfolios that we are saving, every row represents a stock.
